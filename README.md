# aopsapi
I made a node js module! Just go to your coding directory and type npm install aopsapi.
It's far from done and most things don't work but it's going in the right direction. I wouldn't recomend using it yet. v1.1.2 is out I fixed the userID function please let me know if it still doesn't work some of the time. https://banana-cream-pi.github.io/aopsapi/
